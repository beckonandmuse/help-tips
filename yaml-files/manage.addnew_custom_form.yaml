form_fields:
    title: Form Fields
    content: >
        These are the fields within your form that will be available in order to
        gather more ticket information.

    title: Sort

        Click on the up-and-down arrow icon and drag the field row to sort within
        this form. Sorting preference does not take effect until the form is saved.

    title: Label
    content: >
        This label is shown as the prompt for this field. Typically, a short-answer
        field would be rendered like this one:
        
type:
    title: Type
    content: >
        This is used to define the type of input expected from the user. You can
        select from short and long answer, phone number, date and time, checkbox,
        drop-down list, or a custom list selection.
        
internal:
    title: Internal
    content: >
        Fields marked internal are hidden from your clients. Use internal fields to
        track things which only your staff need to access.
        
required:
    title: Required
    content: >
        Forms that have required fields must have valid data before the form can be
        saved. If checked, forms cannot be submitted or saved until all required
        fields are satisfied.
        
Internal fields can only be required of staff members, since they are
        hidden from clients.
        
variable:
    title: Variable
    content: >
        The field data will be available to email and page templates via the name
        used in this column. For instance, fields on the common ticket form are
        available via %{ticket.variable}, where variable is the name used in this
        column.
        
Company information is available via %{company.variable} and user
        information is available via %{ticket.user.variable}
